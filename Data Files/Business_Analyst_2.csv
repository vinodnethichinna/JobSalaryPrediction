TickSmith was founded in 2012 by experts in capital markets and financial services to resolve a global growing problem that affects the financial world; Working efficiently with mountains and mountains of financial data. Today, TickSmith is the industry leader in Big Data applications for the capital markets and financial services. As an industry innovator, TickSmith is more than a place to work, it's a place where your thoughts, ideas and creativity will be heard and leveraged while working on cutting edge products and technology.

We are seeking a candidate with a hybrid profile that has knowledge of data management systems with technical hands-on experience. You will be co-creating a first class Data Management Platform for the financial industry by defining and detailing out the product requirements with the Product Owner, collaborating with the development team to execute on the requirements, and participate in any other steps of a feature launch.

What you’ll be doing

At TickSmith, a product BA participates in all phases of feature development:


Research and Design: participate in defining the problem, requirement gathering, writing stories for scrum, analysis, design sessions, proof of concept, wireframes, etc.. At this stage you may be interacting with clients to understand their pain points, you will be working with development to brainstorm solutions and maybe even run a few experiments with the Product Owner. Let’s get creative! How can we solve our client’s main pain points? Is it a viable solution? Have we addressed the 4 value risks in the feature: value risk, useability risk, feasibility risk and business viability risk?
Defining the feature or requirements: define the feature for the development team, clarify scope and answer any questions the development team may have about the requirement. Clarity in communication is key. Did the team understand what needs to be built?
Manual quality assurance: assisting automation QA and Product Owner with quality assurance of features before deployment to production. Does the feature work as expected? Are there any bugs? A penchant for detail is important at this stage. By the way, are there any spelling mistakes in this text?
Launch! Prepare technical documentation describing the feature, train clients and customer success on how to use the feature, work with marketing for large product launches.
Operations. Working with the Customer Success on making sure the features are up and running. Help collect feedback from clients and development team. How did we fare? What improvements can we make to the feature?


And then back to Research and Design. In reality, all these steps overlap and you get to choose a bit of your own adventure based on your strengths and interests.

About the Alterna Financial Group

Alterna Savings and Credit Union Limited (Alterna) has been the Good in Banking for 111 years!

Alterna has grown from its humble beginnings to be the second largest credit union in Ontario, and one of the Top 10 in Canada, with over $8 billion in assets under management and more than 167,000 members and a network of 35 branches across Ontario. The impressive growth throughout the years stems not only from merging with other credit unions, but also from significantly gaining new retail, business and not-for-profit members as people recognize Alterna’s philosophy of putting members first.

Known for its fast-paced environment, Alterna is viewed as a trailblazer in the industry. Led by a CEO with a passion for innovation, Alterna was the first credit union to introduce a digital bank and the first to offer a fully digital end-to-end mortgage through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alterna Bank.

Alterna is proud of its long history of helping communities thrive. It shared its success in 2018 by donating more than $1 million to the community and, in partnership with employees, contributed 11,300 volunteer hours. Its flagship Community Micro Finance Program also helps underrepresented groups. Since inception, the program has disbursed more than $5 million in impact loans and helped change the lives of more than 1,000 participants and their families.

Alterna is also extremely proud of its corporate culture. With a workforce of more than 600 employees, Alterna is honoured to be recipient of prestigious employer awards, including the National Capital Region’s Top Employers and Aon’s Best Employers (Platinum level) awards.
