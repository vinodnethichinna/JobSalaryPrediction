In practice, this complete redevelopment has meant the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the Core Systems of an insurance company.The Core System has been redeveloped by Skynet Software to achieve 3 main objectives:Pythonic – We believe Python is the only coding language that is simple, elegant and powerful enough to build a sophisticated world class systemHighly Automated – System minimizes human intervention. Everything from quoting policy prices, issuing / renewing / modifying / cancelling policies, interacting with third parties (such as customers, brokers, contractors) will be automated.Risk Focused – Use data driven statistical models and process driven physical models to price and manage risk in real time.Skynet Software employs a high calibre team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff. The team is nearing completion of the redesign process and is looking to add smart software engineers to further optimize its Python code base.JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTSYou know Python and Pandas. We are a Python shop. Everything we do is in Python. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addition, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well. This starts with the basics, such as merges and groupbys, but extends into working with large datasets gigabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.You take pride in your code. You enjoy writing code, ensuring it is simple and elegant, and documenting it carefully and consistently. You get satisfaction from seeing your code go into production and you are happy to follow up with any questions from both systems professionals and end users who are not experts.This is not an AI role. The focus of the role is to improve and maintain the current code base. You may deal with large datasets and encounter machine learning models, but that is not the immediate focus. Other topics you may touch on in this role are scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, databases and front-end interfaces.You are able to adopt a design philosophy.  Our systems generally fall into two categories: pricing and policy management. At this point in time, the framework for both has been set up. You need to be able to understand the code as it exists today, where it is currently at and where we want to take it. You must be flexible enough to adapt to the current design, not the other way around.We are a NoSQL s*hop.* We consider it a strong asset if you understand MongoDB or are able to learn it at an expert level quickly.Familiarity with the dev process. Experience with most or all of the following is a must: the terminal, Git, GitHub, APIs, Unix. You understand that communication is key to staying on track in the development of any software. A large portion of this role will be remote. As a company, we don’t believe in the value of long routine meetings.

In practice, this complete redevelopment has meant the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the Core Systems of an insurance company.The Core System has been redeveloped by Skynet Software to achieve 3 main objectives:Pythonic – We believe Python is the only coding language that is simple, elegant and powerful enough to build a sophisticated world class systemHighly Automated – System minimizes human intervention. Everything from quoting policy prices, issuing / renewing / modifying / cancelling policies, interacting with third parties (such as customers, brokers, contractors) will be automated.Risk Focused – Use data driven statistical models and process driven physical models to price and manage risk in real time.Skynet Software employs a high calibre team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff. The team is nearing completion of the redesign process and is looking to add smart software engineers to further optimize its Python code base.JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTSYou know Python and Pandas. We are a Python shop. Everything we do is in Python. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addition, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well. This starts with the basics, such as merges and groupbys, but extends into working with large datasets gigabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.You take pride in your code. You enjoy writing code, ensuring it is simple and elegant, and documenting it carefully and consistently. You get satisfaction from seeing your code go into production and you are happy to follow up with any questions from both systems professionals and end users who are not experts.This is not an AI role. The focus of the role is to improve and maintain the current code base. You may deal with large datasets and encounter machine learning models, but that is not the immediate focus. Other topics you may touch on in this role are scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, databases and front-end interfaces.You are able to adopt a design philosophy.  Our systems generally fall into two categories: pricing and policy management. At this point in time, the framework for both has been set up. You need to be able to understand the code as it exists today, where it is currently at and where we want to take it. You must be flexible enough to adapt to the current design, not the other way around.We are a NoSQL s*hop.* We consider it a strong asset if you understand MongoDB or are able to learn it at an expert level quickly.Familiarity with the dev process. Experience with most or all of the following is a must: the terminal, Git, GitHub, APIs, Unix. You understand that communication is key to staying on track in the development of any software. A large portion of this role will be remote. As a company, we don’t believe in the value of long routine meetings. An ability to get thoughts across clearly and succinctly is required.WHAT YOU WILL LEARN FROM USThe insurance business: Policies/Coverages/Claims, risk analysis, advanced modelling, all core systems to run an insurance company.Risk modelling: Catastrophes, probabilistic risk analysis, application of machine learning to the insurance world, including the redevelopment of most Actuarial scientific methods.Software Engineering: The design, development in Python, and deployment of an entire scientific software engineering project to run an entire insurance company.

In practice, this complete redevelopment has meant the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the Core Systems of an insurance company.The Core System has been redeveloped by Skynet Software to achieve 3 main objectives:Pythonic – We believe Python is the only coding language that is simple, elegant and powerful enough to build a sophisticated world class systemHighly Automated – System minimizes human intervention. Everything from quoting policy prices, issuing / renewing / modifying / cancelling policies, interacting with third parties (such as customers, brokers, contractors) will be automated.Risk Focused – Use data driven statistical models and process driven physical models to price and manage risk in real time.Skynet Software employs a high calibre team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff. The team is nearing completion of the redesign process and is looking to add smart software engineers to further optimize its Python code base.JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTSYou know Python and Pandas. We are a Python shop. Everything we do is in Python. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addition, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well. This starts with the basics, such as merges and groupbys, but extends into working with large datasets gigabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.You take pride in your code. You enjoy writing code, ensuring it is simple and elegant, and documenting it carefully and consistently. You get satisfaction from seeing your code go into production and you are happy to follow up with any questions from both systems professionals and end users who are not experts.This is not an AI role. The focus of the role is to improve and maintain the current code base. You may deal with large datasets and encounter machine learning models, but that is not the immediate focus. Other topics you may touch on in this role are scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, databases and front-end interfaces.You are able to adopt a design philosophy.  Our systems generally fall into two categories: pricing and policy management. At this point in time, the framework for both has been set up. You need to be able to understand the code as it exists today, where it is currently at and where we want to take it. You must be flexible enough to adapt to the current design, not the other way around.We are a NoSQL s*hop.* We consider it a strong asset if you understand MongoDB or are able to learn it at an expert level quickly.Familiarity with the dev process.

In practice, this complete redevelopment has meant the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the Core Systems of an insurance company.The Core System has been redeveloped by Skynet Software to achieve 3 main objectives:Pythonic – We believe Python is the only coding language that is simple, elegant and powerful enough to build a sophisticated world class systemHighly Automated – System minimizes human intervention. Everything from quoting policy prices, issuing / renewing / modifying / cancelling policies, interacting with third parties (such as customers, brokers, contractors) will be automated.Risk Focused – Use data driven statistical models and process driven physical models to price and manage risk in real time.Skynet Software employs a high calibre team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff. The team is nearing completion of the redesign process and is looking to add smart software engineers to further optimize its Python code base.JOB DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTSYou know Python and Pandas. We are a Python shop. Everything we do is in Python. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addition, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well. This starts with the basics, such as merges and groupbys, but extends into working with large datasets gigabytes in size, developing customized functions, knowing how to speed up computation, etc.You take pride in your code. You enjoy writing code, ensuring it is simple and elegant, and documenting it carefully and consistently. You get satisfaction from seeing your code go into production and you are happy to follow up with any questions from both systems professionals and end users who are not experts.This is not an AI role. The focus of the role is to improve and maintain the current code base. You may deal with large datasets and encounter machine learning models, but that is not the immediate focus. Other topics you may touch on in this role are scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, databases and front-end interfaces.You are able to adopt a design philosophy.  Our systems generally fall into two categories: pricing and policy management. At this point in time, the framework for both has been set up. You need to be able to understand the code as it exists today, where it is currently at and where we want to take it. You must be flexible enough to adapt to the current design, not the other way around.We are a NoSQL s*hop.* We consider it a strong asset if you understand MongoDB or are able to learn it at an expert level quickly.Familiarity with the dev process. Experience with most or all of the following is a must: the terminal, Git, GitHub, APIs, Unix. You understand that communication is key to staying on track in the development of any software.

In practice, this complete redevelopment has meant the re-engineering of almost everything: every function and every interaction with the Core Systems of an insurance company.The Core System has been redeveloped by Skynet Software to achieve 3 main objectives:Pythonic – We believe Python is the only coding language that is simple, elegant and powerful enough to build a sophisticated world class systemHighly Automated – System minimizes human intervention. Everything from quoting policy prices, issuing / renewing / modifying / cancelling policies, interacting with third parties (such as customers, brokers, contractors) will be automated.Risk Focused – Use data driven statistical models and process driven physical models to price and manage risk in real time.Skynet Software employs a high calibre team of scientists, research & engineering, and systems development staff.

We are a Python shop. Everything we do is in Python. You must know Python cold, and not as a simple recreational tool that you have experimented with. In addition, you must know Pandas extraordinarily well.

You enjoy writing code, ensuring it is simple and elegant, and documenting it carefully and consistently. You get satisfaction from seeing your code go into production and you are happy to follow up with any questions from both systems professionals and end users who are not experts.This is not an AI role. The focus of the role is to improve and maintain the current code base. You may deal with large datasets and encounter machine learning models, but that is not the immediate focus. Other topics you may touch on in this role are scientific modeling of natural hazards, curating risk data warehouses, systems engineering, data engineering, the development of DL/ML/AI middleware, databases and front-end interfaces.You are able to adopt a design philosophy.  Our systems generally fall into two categories: pricing and policy management. At this point in time, the framework for both has been set up. You need to be able to understand the code as it exists today, where it is currently at and where we want to take it. You must be flexible enough to adapt to the current design, not the other way around.We are a NoSQL s*hop.* We consider it a strong asset if you understand MongoDB or are able to learn it at an expert level quickly.Familiarity with the dev process.
