GBatteries was founded six years ago to tackle one of the world’s most pressing issues: the transition to a cleaner future through electrification. We are pioneering battery technology which enables ultra-fast charging of Li-ion batteries without compromising battery life — and without changing the battery’s chemistry or manufacturing process. Ultimately, our mission is to accelerate the mass adoption of electric vehicles.
We are working on some of the biggest challenges in energy storage, and are looking for the right people to join us as we develop our technology and continue to scale.

THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE ROLE
As a Software Developer on our Development team, you'll help us build out the core web applications and tools that will serve to enable our research and development teams to effectively test and analyze state-of-the-art batteries. In our small but growing engineering organization, you'll not only be developing and shipping new features but also designing core aspects of GBatteries' testing and data analysis product.
You'll work collaboratively with our Data Science team to deploy machine learning models into a production environment, and with our Firmware team to collect and warehouse high speed data from embedded devices. You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack, and be responsible for projects covering all aspects of the software development life cycle. You will exercise judgment in making trade-offs between design and feasibility. As a developer on our close-knit, cross-functional team, you’ll be an active voice in shaping our products.

THE TEAM
You’ll join a small but growing software team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about creating dependable products. While we are still growing and have plenty to do, we are incredibility supportive of each other and pitch in to support our peers when problems arise.

THE ENGINEERING CULTURE
Autonomy: There's no red tape on what technology frameworks you can use, or what language you should be coding in. We believe in using the best tool(s) for the job, and learning any new ones along the way.
Scope: You won't be adding small features to a monolithic codebase; you will be building entire products from start to finish. Your team members will recognize you for the products you build and the impact these products have on their workflow. You will have the opportunity to identify the business needs for a particular product, work through the development life cycle, and interact with your customers directly.
Interesting Problems: Much of what we do is in uncharted territories. As a result, we are often posed with interesting and challenging engineering problems, which will encourage you to prototype, iterate, and innovate. It's part of the company culture to encourage crazy ideas, and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. Many of the design problems you will encounter won't have answers on Google or Stack Overflow, they will encourage you to come up with unique approaches and strengthen your design thinking.
Growth: Working at a start-up is a great way to supercharge your skillset, and accelerate your learning. You will be put in a fast-paced environment where you're always working at the bleeding edge of technology. Not only will you become a better developer, you will also be given the opportunity to grow within the company as we scale.

We created, drive and are at the forefront of innovation in the Graph Database category; and we’re disrupting how organizations leverage their data to innovate and stay competitive.

Graph databases have grown over 1000% in the last ten years. The use of graphs in data science has also seen a strong adoption and growing interest. The problem is, there’s still a large portion of the data science community who is unfamiliar with when, why, and how to use graphs in their data science solutions. This person would be tackling this problem.

Neo4j is the world’s leading graph database in the world and the Developer Relations team wants to find someone to help build awareness, knowledge, and understanding around graph data science to the overall data science community.

This role will involve educating data scientists about the new opportunities, creating compelling content, and examples for data scientists who want to get started with the tools and techniques of a graph database.

And you have a track record of obtaining requirements, designing, building, implementing,…",https://ca.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=e542ed099c930be3&fccid=55f716fae45d7c0d&vjs=3,"Wanted: An ambuition Data Engineer who will help us better understand our customers

PN is looking for an experienced database engineer who’s passionate about health, fitness and helping people live their best life.

Precision Nutrition is growing, and we need a team-oriented, inquisitive engineer who will help us improve our database management and build a better product. As one of the largest nutrition coaching companies in the world, PN is bigger than it’s ever been — and it’s about to get bigger.


To help us scale, we need a motivated, approachable jack-of-all-trades who knows how to work with stakeholders and users to gather requirements, design ETL and API processes, and take part in execution and QA so we can do what we do best: help millions more people live healthier, happier lives.

Join our Adventure

We’re embarking on a new adventure, and we need a multi-talented engineer to improve our database management

We’ve got an exciting journey ahead of us… Over the next 10 years, Precision Nutrition will be expanding its world-class education and coaching services into a wide range of new fields, including yoga, group exercise, sports coaching, athletics, manual therapy and more. To help us reach our goals and keep us moving forward, we need a data engineer who knows how to build the pipe end to end—from requirements collection to post-rollout support and QA.


Who we’re looking for

A collaborative self-starter, with a keen attention to detail

You know the tools of the trade. You have a solid understanding of data warehousing tools and technology like Snowflake, as well as ETL tools like FiveTran and DBT. You’re experienced with reporting tools such as Tableau, and you can manipulate and analyze data in Python and SQL like a pro. Other similar tools like Heap, Google Analytics, Stripe, and Salesforce are a plus too.


You’re self-motivated. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges. At the same time, you don’t silo yourself, and are always eager to learn more and share with the team.


You like variety. Not only will you be handling all kinds of systems, apps, and technologies — like the tools mentioned above—but you’ll need to help with execution, QA, and other aspects of our database management. You relish new challenges and get excited by the prospect of wearing multiple hats.


You’re flexible. You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a changing environment. You understand that things change as new information is made available, and can flip from one project to another at the drop of a hat when your attention is needed.


You’re a stickler for the details. You are careful, cautious and incredibly meticulous. Some may even call you nitpicky (in an endearing way, of course). You can spot the smallest mistake before it throws a database off course. Nothing slips by the net when you're the goalie.


You work well with others. You aren’t just here to take orders—you’re an expert in your field who knows how to take charge without shutting others out of the process. You can take ideas from multiple sources and synthesize them into a clear course of action—and then execute it with aplomb.


You’re an exceptional communicator. You know how to get your message across clearly and concisely. You know how to say it, write it and present it in both layman’s terms and a bit more formally if needed. You know how to be heard and energize people around you no matter who you are interacting with, and you’re quick to respond when someone needs your help.


You’re adaptable. You’re comfortable working with cross-functional teams, and you can switch gears as smoothly as a Formula 1 driver. You may be working on requirements gathering one day, and doing support and exception handling another, and you relish the idea of taking ownership of the entire data pipeline.

What you’ll be doing

Learning the company’s data needs...

You’ll work with people across the company to assess what data we need to gather. That means:


Interviewing stakeholders, the analytics team, and users. From those people, you’ll gather requirements for data marts that the marketing, client care, and finance teams can use to better understand our customers.
Optimizing the process. You’ll review our existing requirements gathering process, make it better, and design and develop new processes for doing so on future projects.


...and turning that into action

You’ll then build the data model structure and support it from end to end. That includes:


Designing the process. You’ll develop the ETL processes, leveraging existing APIs or working with the tech team to build new ones.
Build and document everything. You’ll build, test, and fine-tune the entire data warehouse, and create detailed documentation so our team isn’t lost when you aren’t around.
Gather feedback and enter support mode. Your job isn’t done once the process is rolled out—you’ll also design new QA, security, privacy, and exception handling procedures, not to mention collect a backlog of enhancement requests and plan out the next release while working on other projects.


A few important caveats

This is a dream job, if you’re the right person for it.

Must-Have #1: You must be experienced.

You’ve spent 5+ years working in a data engineering role of some sort. You’re familiar with some or all of the following: registration and user behavior data, digital marketing information, customer support systems, and survey responses. And you have a track record of obtaining requirements, designing, building, implementing, and supporting ETL processes, dimensional data models, and data repositories for business intelligence and analytics purposes.

Must-Have #2: You must be results-oriented.

You know how to work with others and pay attention to the details—without getting slowed down by either. You know when to take more time and you know when it’s time to move full throttle and get things done. You aren’t satisfied until you’ve seen a project through to completion.


Must-Have #3: You thrive on collaboration.

You’re a self-starter, but you know that great things aren’t built by just one person. You don’t just play nicely with others, you excel at it—instead of being told what to do, you want to meld minds with your coworkers, bring out their best ideas, and build something truly awesome.


Wondering if this is the right path for you?

Every year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.

Here are six reasons why.

Reason #1: We give you the freedom to “do you.”

Unlike most companies, we don’t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You’ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want.

Reason #2: You can work from anywhere.

We’re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. When you join our team, you’re no longer shackled to one desk, one office, one city, or even one country!

Reason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)

You’re an adult. You’re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don’t think you need to attend a meeting, you don’t. Simple as that.

Reason #4: You’ll always feel supported.

In a regular office, it’s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other’s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.

Reason #5: You’ll never be bored.

People often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you’ll get the chance to conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.


Reason #6: You’re free to be you.


At Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives—no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome—as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work. Be you.
