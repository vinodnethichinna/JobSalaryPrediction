We're a committed and talented group of diverse people working hard to solve a real, universal problem for millions of entrepreneurs: businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between doing their books and running their businesses. Bench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of their hands. We've paired smart humans with incredibly powerful software to develop the fastest, most efficient bookkeeping service in history. This lets us provide monthly and yearly financials at an incredibly accessible price, giving business owners the time, confidence, and knowledge they need to be successful.

Bench is growing fast. Recently, we've onboarded our 9000th client and our 500th employee. We have a clear, funded path to profitability, and a roadmap that we believe will rapidly accelerate the trajectory of our business.

This requires an aptitude for numbers and an ability to spot and adapt to trends at a drop of a hat. You will be a critical player in ensuring Bench delivers the most efficient bookkeeping service in the world.

If you'd like to apply your analyst expertise to a dynamic, high-growth environment, this role may be exactly what you're looking for. Reporting to our Senior Operations Analyst, you will have the opportunity to hone your skill set with the support of a high-performing, collaborative team.

Here's some of the things you'll get to work on:

Collaborating with our Finance team to redefine and optimize the Operations financial model
Building systems to connect day-to-day planning with long term forecasts to ensure that tactical decisions align with our latest analyses
Analyze big problems and help understand their impact on business performance
Work with large data sets to summarize and analyze results

Experience translating complex business problems into clear drivers and structured models
Excellent Excel / Google Sheets skills; experience with BI tools and SQL; Tableau experience a plus
Exceptional analytical skills and intuition

You're an even better fit if you have:

A nose for value: You can take a big-picture perspective to identify and stay focused on what's most important
Appreciation for systems: You can connect the dots and figure out the best solution for Bench, not just the stakeholders you're working with
Intellectual curiosity: It's not enough for you to know the what - you want to know the why. You are energized by challenging problems, and are persistent/ resourceful in your efforts to solve them
Startup hustle: You are highly motivated, proactive, comfortable with change and ambiguity. You have a humble, team-player attitude and are ready to pitch in wherever you are needed most

We acknowledge that Bench headquarters is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples, including the territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.

We're a committed and talented group of diverse people working hard to solve a real, universal problem for millions of entrepreneurs: businesses need to understand their financial performance, but for many smaller ones, this means a trade-off between doing their books and running their businesses. Bench solves this dilemma by taking bookkeeping off of their hands. We've paired smart humans with incredibly powerful software to develop the fastest, most efficient bookkeeping service in history. This lets us provide monthly and yearly financials at an incredibly accessible price, giving business owners the time, confidence, and knowledge they need to be successful.

Bench is growing fast. Recently, we've onboarded our 9000th client and our 500th employee. We have a clear, funded path to profitability, and a roadmap that we believe will rapidly accelerate the trajectory of our business. We're looking for the brightest minds who love solving tough problems to join us on this incredible journey, in pursuit of bringing financial mastery to our clients.

What does the Finance department look like?

We're a close-knit team of scrappy, driven folks that is committed to making sure Bench has what it needs to succeed. From accounting, treasury and legal, to strategy, financial planning and analysis, we have a broad portfolio that lets us engage with every part of the business. We enjoy solving problems together through open communication and collaboration while respecting each other's ideas.

As a Financial Analyst on the team, you will play a key role in business-wide reporting and working daily with financial models to keep the business informed, develop insights and help us make great decisions. With new and novel problems every day, our Finance team can provide you with a wealth of real business experience you're not going to get at a larger company.

We're not going to sugarcoat it–there will be some boring stuff (shout out to revenue reconciliations!) and there will be difficult challenges, but that's balanced with the opportunity to learn new things every day, help build a world-class business. Come jump into the deep end with us – it'll be the most valuable experience you can get.

What you'll be getting up to:

Maintaining a complex financial model to help assess and predict business unit performance
Build and communicate reporting on budget vs actual performance
Analyze problems and help understand their impact on business performance
Work with large data sets to summarize and analyze results
Reconcile and report revenue data

To be successful in this role, you'll need to have:

1-3 years of experience in accounting, finance consulting, strategy, business intelligence or a related field
Degree in Business, Economics, Engineering, or other quantitative fields
Exceptional analytical skills and intuition
Comfort working with quantitative and qualitative data
Experience building financial models
Excellent Excel / Google Sheets skills; experience with BI tools and SQL; Tableau experience a plus

It could be an even better fit if you:

A nose for value: You can take a big-picture perspective to identify and stay focused on what's most important.
Systems thinker: Everything is connected. You can pick apart a problem or operation and understand what each piece does.
Intellectual curiosity: It's not enough for you to know the what - you want to know the why. You are energized by challenging problems and are persistent/resourceful in your efforts to solve them.
Startup hustle: You are highly motivated, proactive, comfortable with change and ambiguity. You have a humble, team-player attitude paired with grit, and are ready to pitch in wherever you are needed most.

The extra details:

This is a full-time permanent position because we want to spend lots of time with your wonderful self!
This position offers an annual salary, stock options, and an extended benefits package that includes health, dental, and vision.
Our office has gone fully remote! We'll set you up with everything you need to work from home, from day one.

We believe that unchecked biases disproportionately impact the most marginalized people in society—including but not limited to BIPOC, LGBTQ2S+ people, immigrants, and people with disabilities. We strongly encourage applications from people with these identities or other marginalized communities because we believe that without you, we are all less. At Bench, we don't stand for tokenism. We stand for representation."

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe DocIntel, membre du groupe AI Platform, est une équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des produits basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour faciliter le traitement des documents de façon intelligente. Pour accomplir cela, nous nous appuyons sur un mélange d'approches d'apprentissage profond à la fine pointe de la technologie, d'approches d'apprentissage automatique classiques et de conception axée sur la personne.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.
Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.
Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience en vision par ordinateur et en apprentissage automatique classique. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.
Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.
Vous êtes pragmatique et comprenez que la solution technique appropriée pour résoudre un problème est celle qui apportera de la valeur à notre client, que ce soit un algorithme d'apprentissage automatique classique qui a fait ses preuves ou un algorithme d'apprentissage profond à la fine pointe.
Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe de solutions – science et recherche accompagne les clients d'Element AI dans leur parcours vers l'IA. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts de l'intelligence artificielle dont le travail vise avant tout à répondre aux besoins concrets de nos clients. Nous souhaitons avoir un impact direct sur les interactions de nos utilisateurs avec leurs données, afin que cette relation leur permette de jouir d'un avantage puissant sur leurs concurrents. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission. Vous devrez donc adopter une approche axée sur le client.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, du point de vue de la prévision. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation, représentation et analyse chronologique, nettoyage et ingénierie de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :

Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;
Vous serez étonné de tout ce que vous apprendrez;
Culture d'entreprise ouverte et inclusive.

Element AI souscrit au principe de l'égalité d'accès à l'emploi et favorise la diversité au sein du personnel.

Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The Science and Research solution team supports Element AI's clients on their AI journey. We are a group of artificial intelligence experts who thrives on solving concrete client needs. We aim to have a direct impact on our users' interactions with data and that this relationship is the key to get an unfair advantage on their competitors. The team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in various fields such as time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission. As such you will have a customer-first mindset.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from a forecasting perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series data representation, modelling and analysis, data cleaning & engineering, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models and machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:

Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages “unboring” solutions to problems. We enable all new team members to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor, and team. At the end of the day, we are all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Where You Come In:
Conduct end-to-end analyses, from wrangling data via SQL or Python, to statistical modeling, to hypothesizing and presenting business ideas.
Work with large, complex datasets.
Lead the development of machine learned models for offline, batch-based data products as well as models deployed to online, real-time services.
Work in areas such as search, ads targeting, spam, and photo understanding.

Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe de solutions – science et recherche accompagne les clients d'Element AI dans leur parcours vers l'IA. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts de l'intelligence artificielle dont le travail vise avant tout à répondre aux besoins concrets de nos clients. Nous souhaitons avoir un impact direct sur les interactions de nos utilisateurs avec leurs données, afin que cette relation leur permette de jouir d'un avantage puissant sur leurs concurrents. Nous sommes une équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission. Vous devrez donc adopter une approche axée sur le client.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, du point de vue de la prévision. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation, représentation et analyse chronologique, nettoyage et ingénierie de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :

Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;
Vous serez étonné de tout ce que vous apprendrez;
Culture d'entreprise ouverte et inclusive.

Element AI souscrit au principe de l'égalité d'accès à l'emploi et favorise la diversité au sein du personnel. Nous ne pratiquons aucune discrimination sur la base de la race, de la religion, de la couleur de peau, du pays d'origine, du sexe, de l'orientation sexuelle, de l'âge, de l'état matrimonial, du statut d'ancien combattant ou des incapacités.


Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The Science and Research solution team supports Element AI's clients on their AI journey. We are a group of artificial intelligence experts who thrives on solving concrete client needs. We aim to have a direct impact on our users' interactions with data and that this relationship is the key to get an unfair advantage on their competitors. The team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in various fields such as time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission. As such you will have a customer-first mindset.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from a forecasting perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series data representation, modelling and analysis, data cleaning & engineering, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models and machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:

Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;
Open and inclusive company culture.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status."

What does Analytics at Scotia really mean?
We like to think of ourselves as superheroes, using the power of data to benefit the Bank and its customers! We make data-driven decisions that protect our customers, and we partner with internal clients, like our Marketing and Engineering teams, to lead data-driven initiatives that align with critical business objectives.

A couple of key projects we’ve recently worked on include…

Search Engine for Scotiabankers: We have a lot of smart people working together at Scotiabank, but sometimes it’s hard to stay on top of information (not to mention acronyms)! We created a bank-wide search engine that links to the millions of pages that are buried in the background but hold valuable information.


Scotiabank’s new mobile banking app: While this was a collaborative effort, the Analytics and Data Science teams played an integral role in the development of the new Scotia app. With a customer-first mindset and approach, we supported the teams by helping them target audiences more intelligently. We know that a student has different needs than a first time home buyer, and we’re making sure that information is relevant based on personalization.
